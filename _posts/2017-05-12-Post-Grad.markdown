Yesterday, I took my last final exam of college.

In about a month I start working full time full time as a Software Engineer.
It'll be the start of a regular schedule, something that up to now has been
hard to come by.

# Hobbies

I've always been someone who desperately wanted to get very proficient
at...a fair number of things. Right now, these are what I want to focus on:

- Journalling/Blogging
- Drawing
- Learning German
- Cooking and Meal-planning
- Reading
- Exercise

## Journalling/Blogging

My memory isn't the best, nor is my ability to track the progress on my goals.
To remedy this, I plan on making posts weekly about my life and how I've done
in trying to improve myself via various means.

## Drawing

I've wanted to be a capable artist ever since I was a ["sensitive
boy"][wells-for-boys] in middle school. I've made drawings, comics, and digital
paintings ever since then, but always on-and-off. So I'm hoping to set aside a
fixed amount of time to making visual ~~art~~ stuff. More details to come.

## Learning German

I got German citizenship in 2016 thanks to [Article 116 par. 2 of the Basic
Law][restored-citizenship]. I hope to become more knowledgable about the German
language as well as German culture beyond my 4-weeks-of-German-1 education.
Hopefully I can visit sometime in the near future and put those skills to use!

I plan on using [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) in conjunction with some
textbooks and audio programs. I'll let you know how things go.

## Cooking and Meal-planning

I have historically eaten quite poorly and depended heavily on prepared foods
and restaurants and fast food eateries. To help alleviate that, I plan on
cooking gaining more experience with home cooking. My goal is to get more
confident in the kitchen as well as achieve a slightly healthier BMI.

I'm organizing recipes on a [Trello board][food-trello]. I invite you to take a
look at what I've got so far. I plan on reporting back on what I make, so stay
tuned.

## Reading

I got back into reading last year after a several year drought. I'm currently
reading [The Lathe of Heaven][lathe-on-wikipedia] and loving it. I'll be giving
my thoughts on books as I read them on this blog. If you've got any
recommendations, send them to me, but do know that it may take some time to get
to them.

## Exercise

I have several times planned while at college to run in a half marathon, but
always failed to adequately prepare. I'm getting back on that horse. Hopefully
2017 will be the year that it happens :)

# Goals

All of these things are probably going to make me a healthier and more
knowledgable person. This is *partially* what I'm after. I think the larger end
goal is to be a weird, interesting, but not terrible internet person. 

Bill Wurtz is very good at doing this. He's the person who made this:

and also this, more than a year later:

<iframe width="560" height="315"

allowfullscreen></iframe>

He also does other, much more "bizarre" stuff like an [online q & a
project][bill-wurtz-q-and-a] that has been going for years now. He responds
to this at nearly all hours of the day.

The man is unique. He makes tiny fascinating things and just pushes them off
the shore like a little baby Moses, assuming baby Moses had a strong
resemblance to [10 second long snail vids][snails].

Anyway, that's the main overarching planâ€”to make things people having made
before that make people's lives better (and also not worse).
