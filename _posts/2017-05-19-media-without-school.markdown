I had both of my last official "school" events this week without much in the
way of responsibilities, so the past 7 days have mostly been that of
celebration. In terms of my foci, I haven't been the *best*, (and I don't want
to rep. this excuse for much longer) but I like to think that this first week
counts as a bit of vacation time. Obviously that implies that I see the activities as work, which I'm not particularly happy with, but hopefully that'll change...in time.

## Blogging

I wanted to blog once a week. This is a week later, so I guess this is going
well.

## Drawing

I got out the large newsprint pad and made a pretty bad (but not offensively
bad) sketch of Dave Chappelle while watching one of his new comedy specials on
Netflix. I probably should have done a full human figure sketch session, but it
was late night and hey, this already sounds like an excuse right?

## Learning German

I haven't touched this at all, to be honest. I'm a bit worried about
information overload as I learn [Ruby][ruby] and [Rails][rails] for work. 
Reflecting on this, I don't think a little Duolingo will kill me.

## Cooking

I am trying to minimize buying new food on account of moving, but I was able to
make [turkey bolognese][turkey-bolognese-recipe], and the process was very
different from normal. Not the cooking itself, but the anxiety related to it.

Normally, deciding I'm going to cook a dish other than a few staples brings
with it a number of undesirable side-effects:

- anxiety over *planning* to go to the market
- anxiety over going to the market and taking excessive amounts of time
- anxiety over not getting the right ingredients
- anxiety over getting to much of the right ingredients
- anxiety over not following the recipe
- anxiety over following the recipe too obsessively
- anxiety over the amount of time the cooking takes
- anxiety about all of the above anxieties 

None of that happened this time. I even went off recipe actually! It felt
marvelously new and refreshing. The sauce wasn't the best, but at least I made
it without having a nervous breakdown! :)

## Reading

I've been reading [*The Lathe of Heaven*][lathe-on-wikipedia] still, right
before bed. Haven't made the most progress recently, though. Keep staying up
working on the computer (like right now for instance.)

## Exercise

This I've been pretty consistent with. I'm about 3 out of 8 weeks into my much
repeated ["Couch to 5K" Program][c25k]. It's really good for starting up again from
long periods of inactivity.

## 22, A Million and Spotify

What is it I like about this album? I've listened to it many times (end-to-end)
in rapid succession but I'm just starting to piece together why now. 

A while back I started working on a game called "CENTROID" which featured a
virtual "knight" of sorts engaged in a religious crusade—a war with other
programs—motivated by legends of faith and violence passed down by a corrupt
church.

For some reason I feel many parallels between the story I had in my head (and
failed to implement in a finished game) and the sounds I hear. What comes to
mind is a shapeless, locationless[^1] space, filled with floating, tiny islands
of life; each with different voices, different colors, and having seemingly
limitless contents and variety. A sort of [game of
life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) but but with each
creature broken—beautiful and tragic in the way that a shattered pane of glass
is made up of numerous perfectly unique but wholly incapacitated shards.

That's definitely the highest ambition I could have for the game, and here it
is in the form of an album. I don't think I ever came even close to making such
a "thing," but damn am I glad that I found something that exceeded that vision.

One thing that Bon Iver is able to do with their vocals is bring a sort of
unifying "superorganism" structure to these many drifting pieces, creating
something like these unworldly bird swarms:

It's so damn strange and beautiful.

I found this album thanks to a Spotify's algorithm, which is a weird thing to
thank in a way. Recommendations from friends carry with them this weight of a
personal faith in the work in addition to the assumed similarity between your
tastes and what the work has to offer. 

Spotify's recommendation engine works, however, by gathering data from
[numerous
sources](https://www.slideshare.net/MrChrisJohnson/from-idea-to-execution-spotifys-discover-weekly/40-Scaling_to_100_Weekly_refreshTime)
(e.g. the playlists other people make, your listening habits, articles online,
etc.) and tries to line them all up to its conception of "you" with stuff like
machine learning (basically training a program like you would a dog).

I also found the song ["Kaval
Sviri"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVqrW-fPOQ0) just a few months ago and
fell in love with it, among other Bulgarian all-female choir pieces. I arrived
at it via a [mixtape](https://soundcloud.com/gorillaz/noodle) put out by
Gorillaz.

Would I have listened found "Kaval Sviri" if I hadn't been led by another human
being with an appreciation for their music and their notion that "this should
be heard"? And is there music I am not listening to now because of reliance on
algorithmically found content? My guess is no for both. 

Unlike most pieces about changing technology, I'm not going to frame this as a
survival-of-the-fittest competition between the traditional and the new. Both
avenues of discovery are useful and readily accessible. If you've been going
down one for a while exclusively, try the other. You might find something
beautiful.
