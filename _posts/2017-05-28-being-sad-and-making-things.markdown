The title is a pretty good descriptor. Also, German!

## Foci

### Blogging

Well, it's my third week doing this and I'm a couple days late (Sunday instead
of Friday)... but here I am!

### Drawing

I'll talk about this more in the "week topic" section of this post, but it's
been somewhat productive.

### Learning German

I've actually started with this. The quantity and quality of online offerings
are somewhat surprising given the current explosion in "innovative tech
solutions" to "traditional problems" like [I need a mattress][casper] and [I
want juice][juicero]. Aside from [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com) and
[Memrise](https://memrise.com), there's not many new forays into this space.
The new generation of [MOOCs][mooc-wikipedia] (Khan Academy, Coursera, and
Udacity) don't offer language courses[^1]. Luckily I've got some textbooks and
audio programs from a very kind friend which will help compliment the limited
online offerings.

Overall, Duolingo is really well builtâ€”much better than I first gave it a spin
when it came out some 5 years ago. Just for a bit of background, I'd recommend
a [TED Talk by the creator Luis von Ahn][duolingo-ted-talk] about the concept.
Do note that the article translation side of the website has [recently been
removed][duolingo-ama] with only 0.05% of users actually engaging with it. I
suppose the high ambitions a Wikipedia-like free base of labor may not work in
the translation space (or at least work well *enough*).

### Cooking and Exercise

Not a great week for either of these things, unfortunately. Since moving, I
fell out of my exercise routine and cooking in my new space has been more
stressful and anxiety inducing. I hope I can make improvements in these areas
this week and get back into a pattern that works for me.

### Reading

I read [_This One Summer_][this-one-summer-amazon] by Mariko and Jillian Tamaki
this past week. I had seen Jillian's work when spotting [_SuperMutant Magic
Academy_][supermutant-amazon] while working at the library, so I was interested
in this collaboration she did with her cousin Mariko. Overall, the book fits
its 3.5/5 star rating on Amazon. While I think it is nice as a YA book, it
doesn't gain much when being read with a bit more years of life behind oneself.
Beautiful artwork throughout, however.

## My art and my depression

I'm a bit trepidacious about describing this stuff publicly, but not enough to
stop, it seems. When drawing for the first time since graduation this week, I
started entering a pretty nasty depression spiral. I have really wanted to make
comics to summarize how I've been feeling, but coming up with original, novel
ideas when I am depressed is a very signficant challenge for me. I can work on
objective tasks like physics or programming problems, but creative expression
starts feeling like drawing blood from a stone.

For some reason, switching to working with digital tools helped a bit. Maybe it
was the infinite forgiveness of Photoshop, the limitless color options, or
[these sick brushes][kyle-brush]... but either way, it got me (enough) out of
that pit that night. I hope to post the digital painting on Instagram sometime
this week. Hopefully I actually finish it. Here's a close-up of the work in
progress.
