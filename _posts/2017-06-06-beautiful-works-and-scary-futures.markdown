So this is about 4 days late...I suppose the streak of punctuality is pretty
much gone. (I would *like* to claim that) the reason is because I've been
helping my <abbr title="significant other">SO</abbr> move across the state, but
excuses are excuses. I'm currently at home visiting the folks until I start my
new job, so hopefully next (or I guess this) week won't be so late.

## Foci
### Blogging

This is late, so not doing too great here.

### Drawing

That painting from the last post is ["finished,"][my-painting] though I've
grown less and less satisfied with it as time has gone on. I haven't drawn or
painted anything since then, which isn't great. For some reason I have it in my
mind that I have to have all of my environment and preparation perfect to go
about certain activities, including drawing. It's probably just a form of
procrastination.

### Learning German

This has been my area of greatest success this past week...probably because of
how gameified the learning process is with tools like Duolingo and Memrise.

### Cooking

I made [this soy glazed chicken breast][chicken-recipe] recipe and it turned
out very well, even with some missing and substituted ingredients (no dark
mushroom soy sauce and teriyaki sauce subbing for hoisin sauce[^1]). I also
made some similar chicken on the grill at home with a *extra* fancy premade
marinade. Despite ~~almost~~ definitely burning it, it turned out alright.

### Exercise

I ran once since that other blog post. I'm most disappointed with myself in
this area.

## *Your Name*

This is the first anime film I've ever seen in theaters[^2] and I absolutely
loved it. It's gotten pretty significant praise (currently holding 98% on
Rotten Tomatoes).

Even though it's got a pretty well explored premise (it's a body swap movie), I
think the rest of plot supplies more than enough interesting narrative threads
to make up for it. It also doesn't dip much into the misogynist/transphobic
tropes common in K-dramas that feature the same device, which is refreshing.
The heart of the film is daring, when it comes down to it.  It's also got
gorgeous visualsâ€”not surprising considering that it's from the same studio as
*5 cm per second*.

If you need more to convince you, here's a [glowing review from The
Atlantic][the-atlantic-your-name].

## IKEA

I recently packed an SUV to the brim with IKEA furniture with my SO and it was
honestly the closest I've ever felt to being an adult. If you want a confidence
booster and a incredibly large amount of economical furniture, I would
recommend packing an SUV with IKEA boxes and reveling in your resulting
satisfaction.

## Depression and hurting those around you

I'd say one of the more novel ways in which depression makes my life worse is
how it can cloud my judgement towards the people close to me. I got in a
depressive spiral the other night with my SO and made a hateful comment that I
shouldn't have made--and wouldn't have made in the right mind. Sometimes
thinking about the things I might say during those spirals frightens me.

## The Lathe of Heaven

I wanted to write about this book more extensively, but can't seem to find the
words. It's a novel about dreams and navigates them deftly...so much so that
one feels to be wrapped in a dream when reading. Le Guin is a master of her
craft and this book is certainly worth a read. Thanks to the friend who
recommended this to me.

	but please forgive me for Trader Joe's lack of hoisin.
