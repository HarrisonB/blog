This week felt more like a vacation than any other recently. I spent most of it
with my family (parents, brother, SO, best friends, doggo) and did very little
work towards my longer term goals. My phone and much of my data was temporarily
inaccessible this week, which I'll admit was not *that* big of a deal, but felt
like something worthy of panicking over.

## Foci
### Blogging

This is once again late. I think I should switch the update day to Monday as
the weekends tend to get away from me in general.

By the way, if you'd like to get an email when there's a new post, just fill
out [this form](http://eepurl.com/cSpTij).

### Drawing

I didn't draw anything this week. This is not good. I want to at least get a
comic out by the next blog post.

### Learning German

I only spent one day this week learning German. Despite it being a heavy day
for that activity, I certainly retained less than previous weeks. Consistency
outpaces zeal, to no one's surprise...

### Cooking

I don't think I *made* much food this week besides some (beef) burgers earlier
today.

Last year, I ate red meat only once a month, though this year I've been far
less stringent. I think my personal end goal is to approach a vegetarian diet,
but that's only going to happen if I make more of an effort to eat less meat.
So I should gather up more vegetarian recipes (or at least give tofu a chance).

### Exercise

I didn't do any exercise this past week (besides struggling to assemble a
propane grill). The past few days I've had a ligament pain that I've been able
to use an excuse, but hopefully that will subside soon and the only thing in my
way will be a laziness hurdle.

## California Adventures

Thanks to the incredible generosity of some good friends, I was able to go to
California Adventure this past week. It's truly remarkable how consistent and
uniformly "Disney" the entire park is, while attempting to remain inviting to
anyone and everyone. 

I've only been to the Disney parks 3 times in my life[^1], despite growing up
in Southern California and being of relatively affluent origin, with gaps of
four years or so in between each visit.  It's interesting to see how my
perspective on the experience has changed over the years:
* Rides seem to last so much shorter than they used to, despite my (perceived)
increase in patience
* The most enjoyable parts of the park were those where we as patrons were able
to make our own fun amongst ourselves
* Alcohol could change one's experience of the park *radically*

## Driving in Los Angeles

This past week I've had to drive very frequently in (actual) Los Angeles. I've
never been much of a confident driver, so the experience has been fairly
stressful. Many of the commonly accepted practices on older roads (e.g.
unprotected lefts, passing by crossing into the opposing lane, etc.) still seem
so ridiculously insane and dangerous.

In writing this section I wanted to look up the number of motor vehicle related
deaths per year in the US. That number is around 32,000; you can check out the
data [here][gov-crash-data] if you want. It's fairly interesting. I also
stumbled upon [this Washington Post article][wapo-car-crashes] about the
demographics of motor vehicle related deaths in the US. When driving around LA,
I would often think about the process of learning how to drive in such a
stressful driving environment (navigating confusing 5 way intersections, being
forced to make split-second lane changing decisions, etc.) The Post article
puts the associated dangers in terms of class and education, which I had never
really thought about deeply. It hints at this current excitement about new
self-driving cars and other advanced safety features for automotive transport
and the relative extravagance of such desires.

I keep coming back to this problem of balancing these wants with the relative
inequality of society overall. There's [this comic][pfsc-comic] by John
Campell[^2], which I often think about when this topic comes to mind. I don't
think its universally applicable, but it does make me think about our
notion of creating a vision of the future, and whom that vision rewards.

Take salt iodization. Now that's an undertaking that is easily applicable to
pretty much every country on Earth. Iodine deficiency is the leading
preventable cause of mental retardation and effects around 2 billion
people.[^3] Of course, none of this "futurism" is an "either/or". We can have
self driving cars and a goiter free population. This isn't supposed to be a
guilt trip about how much worse other people have it, either. It's just that
when the goal is to make money, public health programs (like road safety
improvements or salt iodization infrastructure) don't offer the *direct*
returns that something like a marketable product might. So I guess in this
rambling section, I am just stressing that this process of "making the
future"[^4] should, as a good rule of thumb, improve the lives of people unlike
yourself if you're feeling overall fairly comfortable.

## Balance

I'm getting to a point in my life (I think most people call it adulthood or
something) where it's becoming very difficult to feel like I'm spending enough
time with those around me. I suppose writing this after the previous section
seems a bit ironic, but even day-to-day, divvying up the tiny slices of
sunlight can feel intractable, especially when that opportunity is clearly
bounded by approaching dates. Don't think there's an easy answer here.

## Margaritas 

These are good. Even if I don't like tequila.
