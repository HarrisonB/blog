It's been the second week with my immediate family and SO as a sort of
vacation. Again, not super productive with regards to the foci, but eh, I'm
citing the holiday excuse once again.

## Foci
### Blogging
I'm here! In time again (for the adjusted due date anyway).
### Drawing
Haven't been drawing. Again, a bummer. I even brought my tablet with me on the
trip!
### Learning German
Messed this one up again as well.
### Exercise
Well this is embarrassing. I walked the dog a couple of times, at least.
### Cooking
Ah ha! Finally, something I can talk about. I made a few recipes, actually.

First off, I made two very simple meals (marinated chicken using a bottled
marinade and simply seasoned burgers) and they were both confidence building
experiences. Turns out, using a (gas) grill isn't that hard after all.[^1] The
secret is an instant read meat thermometer! Effective at calming the
under/over-cooking anxiety. Oh, and [butterfly slicing chicken
breasts][butterfly-chicken] for more even cooking.

I'm most proud of [the sun-dried tomato
chicken][sun-dried-tomato-chicken-recipe] that I made. I had it made once
before the previous summer, but this time I attempted a full meal with side
dishes. It was very stressful, but quite satisfying overall! I am loving
cooking more complicated recipes. The flavor was well worth the added effort.
You can really taste the mustard, lemon, basil, and the rest.

Some notes:

- The portions for the crust mix are a little excessive; you could probably use
maybe 25-33% less. To reduce waste with the mustard/mayo coating, I'd just make
a 1:1 mix as necessary.
- The ingredients are not super cheap, but it's not too bad compared to a nice
dinner out for four. And cooking with someone else is extra fun! Or a test of
your relationship, at least. Not that this totally needs two people, but
another hand is always nice.
- Only the smallest chicken breast will take 20 minutes to cook all the way.
After that point, I'd just check every 3-4 min to see when they hit the right
temperature with your thermometer.

I also made [these slow cooker chicken burrito bowls][burrito-bowl-trello],
which were a bit disappointing, though I can't expect much from a one-pot rice,
beans, chicken, etc. recipe. I'd recommend using just a large jar of salsa
instead of the tomatoes and spices[^2] and making rice separately in the future
(my rice got fairly mushy).

## *Crack-Up*

This album (as every reviewer of the album has stated) comes after a 6 year
lapse by Fleet Foxes. It's a challenging listen, which is a term that I can't
define here, but just feels right to me. Fleet Foxes have had a huge influence
upon my appreciation of music, so I've been waiting for this release ever since
their previous *Helplessness Blues*â€”which has been on a CD in the car ever
since its release in 2011.

Here's the first track, which is my favorite of the album. I hope you give it a
listen.

## Embarrassment 

I had one of the most mortifying experiences of my life the other day. I won't
get into details for somewhat obvious reasons. It was a private embarrassment,
shared with only one other person. It is so strange to be in the process of
doing something normal and suddenly be reduced to a child in your own eyes.

## *Oh, Hello on Broadway*

Footnotes

[^1]: The internet tells me that charcoal tastes better, but starting cooking
	almost instantly is well worth it to me.

[^2]: The cost of the salsa is well offset by the better balance and variety of
	flavor.
