It's been the second week with my immediate family and SO as a sort of
vacation. Again, not super productive with regards to the foci, but eh, I'm
citing the holiday excuse once again.

## Foci
### Blogging
I'm here! In time again (for the adjusted due date anyway).
### Drawing
Haven't been drawing. Again, a bummer. I even brought my tablet with me on the
trip!
### Learning German
Messed this one up again as well.
### Exercise
Well this is embarrassing. I walked the dog a couple of times, at least.
### Cooking
Ah ha! Finally, something I can talk about. I made a few recipes, actually.

First off, I made two very simple meals (marinated chicken using a bottled
marinade and simply seasoned burgers) and they were both confidence building
experiences. Turns out, using a (gas) grill isn't that hard after all.[^1] The
secret is an instant read meat thermometer! Effective at calming the
under/over-cooking anxiety. Oh, and [butterfly slicing chicken
breasts][butterfly-chicken] for more even cooking.

I'm most proud of [the sun-dried tomato
chicken][sun-dried-tomato-chicken-recipe] that I made. I had it made once
before the previous summer, but this time I attempted a full meal with side
dishes. It was very stressful, but quite satisfying overall! I am loving
cooking more complicated recipes. The flavor was well worth the added effort.
You can really taste the mustard, lemon, basil, and the rest.

Some notes:

- The portions for the crust mix are a little excessive; you could probably use
maybe 25-33% less. To reduce waste with the mustard/mayo coating, I'd just make
a 1:1 mix as necessary.
- The ingredients are not super cheap, but it's not too bad compared to a nice
dinner out for four. And cooking with someone else is extra fun! Or a test of
your relationship, at least. Not that this totally needs two people, but
another hand is always nice.
- Only the smallest chicken breast will take 20 minutes to cook all the way.
After that point, I'd just check every 3-4 min to see when they hit the right
temperature with your thermometer.

I also made [these slow cooker chicken burrito bowls][burrito-bowl-trello],
which were a bit disappointing, though I can't expect much from a one-pot rice,
beans, chicken, etc. recipe. I'd recommend using just a large jar of salsa
instead of the tomatoes and spices[^2] and making rice separately in the future
(my rice got fairly mushy).

## *Crack-Up*

This album (as every reviewer of the album has stated) comes after a 6 year
lapse by Fleet Foxes. It's a challenging listen, which is a term that I can't
define here, but just feels right to me. Fleet Foxes have had a huge influence
upon my appreciation of music, so I've been waiting for this release ever since
their previous *Helplessness Blues*â€”which has been on a CD in the car ever
since its release in 2011.

Here's the first track, which is my favorite of the album. I hope you give it a
listen.

## Embarrassment 

I had one of the most mortifying experiences of my life the other day. I won't
get into details for somewhat obvious reasons. It was a private embarrassment,
shared with only one other person. It is so strange to be in the process of
doing something normal and suddenly be reduced to a child in your own eyes.

## *Oh, Hello on Broadway*

I am a *huge* fan of John Mulaney. He strongly reminds me of Jerry Seinfeld...a
comparison he is [quite used to by now][mulaney-seinfeld]. To be honest, the
comparison doesn't make much sense upon examination. Seinfeld prides himself
on his clean act discussing the minutiae of everyday life, while Mulaney dips
(occasionally) into the sexual and grotesque, borrowing strongly upon his own
"lived" experiences, trading immediate relatability for peculiarity. However,
their cadences do share a great deal of similarity, which is difficult to
ignore when they are essentially vocal entertainers.

In Mulaney's newest creation with Nick Kroll, the pair play two old men from
the Upper West Side in a satire of Broadway's tropes among other things. It's
one of the most polished comedic performances I've ever seen, and if you like
Seinfeld, Mulaney, or theater, or all of the above, its worth a watch. Here's
the trailer.

## First Day

Today was my first day at my new job as a software engineer. To be honest, I
had a wonderful time. I am really excited about the work I'm going to be doing
and the people with whom I will be working.

I am concerned about the onset of imposter syndrome, but hopefully, awareness
of this possibility will help.

[^1]: The internet tells me that charcoal tastes better, but starting cooking
	almost instantly is well worth it to me.

[^2]: The cost of the salsa is well offset by the better balance and variety of
	flavor.
