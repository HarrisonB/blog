## Work

I started work as a software engineer at a startup last Monday. It's taken up a
lot of my time. I really do enjoy the work as well as well as the people with
whom I work. 

What's rough is starting from such a low point again. Work feels much like the
first semester of college in that way. There's so much to learn and you're just
surrounded by people who are miles ahead of you. It's not that it's an
impossible feat, but the knowledge that it
will take a *while* to get into that comfortable groove. The first few days
felt so difficult. Was I supposed to be there? Are they sure they didn't make a
mistake? 

I am prone to "self-defeatism," so luckily, after identifying this—let's just
say—*unhelpful* thought process, the week got a fair bit easier. I even
accomplished some things. Hurray!

## Everything else

I was able to spend time with friends during the weekend, which I greatly
appreciate. All of the other activities, however, have fallen by the wayside. I
haven't been reading, cooking, or running. I know that there's enough time in
the day but I just keep getting distracted by unimportant things. I had planned
to draw today, but it just didn't come together.

## The internet as a telescope

I always become engrossed when my laptop becomes a spyglass of sorts. I've
written about [reddit.com/r/self](reddit.com/r/self) before, and today I took
another dive into it, in a manner of speaking.

It feels both innocent and shameful to browse at length what people post on the
Internet. You get a look into them, into their very hearts, without so much as
making creak in their hallway. It's as if each person created a museum of
their life, opened the door, and then left, bringing new artifacts every so
often, but never bumping into any of the invisible, faceless patrons that
shuffle in. And one day they leave, and you almost never know why.

It's sad, it's beautiful, and it's the most unique yet significant emotion I
associate with the web. I was raised on this thing. I have spent more time with
it than probably any one person, and this precious haunting feeling is the one
that keeps sticking around. And as long as websites and people die, that
feeling isn't going anywhere.
