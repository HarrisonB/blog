This week: slightly more than nothing.

<!--more-->

## Foci
### Drawing
I drew a comic for the first time in months
### Everything else
I continued my impressive streak of failing my other goals

## Feeling lost 

I'm not really sure who I am anymore? 
When I finished school I was told over and over that it was the end of one
phase of my life and the beginning of another. Once again, the advice that had
been repeated ad-nauseum was true. Turns out that experience does *in fact*
yield wisdom for most people.

Anyway, let's get back to what I'm attempting to say. "I'm not really sure who
I am anymore?"[^1] I don't think I really knew when I left school either. I
just had a list of ambitions. No end goal really. I think part of the idea was
to stave off the depression that had left me stuck at zero miles an hour.
"Cultivating my own garden" and all that. But now I've got to secure those
ambitions against my own attacks once again. With so little free time, so many
privileges, actual independence and all that...I've got to have a mission.
Something at which I may aim this advantage and these (hopefully) noble
intentions. Otherwise those debilitating doubts and self-criticisms will be
back.

## Offerings

This week I don't have much of mine to offer you, dear reader. I will however
leave you with some nice music by [Chris
Bryant](https://chrismbryant.bandcamp.com).

Footnotes

[^1]: It's beautiful how the English language allows us to force any *Akira*-esque combination of words[^2] into a question.[^3]
[^2]: I'm not going to link to a clip because if you have seen it, you'll remember, and if you haven't, it's *really* ***not*** going to entice you to watch the movie[^4]
[^3]: Okay, despite the quotes and the references, I'm not about to analyze this like we're in the middle of some high school English essay, don't worry. I'm not that full of myself just yet.
[^4]: Yes, this has unnecessary footnotes of footnotes
[^5]: I actually have no idea what TKX *is*. It could be a producer, publisher, artist, or just a damn consolidator of random tracks. It claims to be "over", but it's still posting new music, so who the hell knows.
