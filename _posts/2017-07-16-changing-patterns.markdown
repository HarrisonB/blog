When I sit down to write these, I'm always reflecting on my mistakes (being
nearly a week late, for instance). I find it funny how we often use "reflect"
in reference to consideration of our errors when its primary definition is near
perfect reproduction. When we reflect upon ourselves, we want to see something
different, but we just see ourselves looking back.

# Change

I went to the doctor for the first time in an embarrassingly long period for a
digestive related issue. I'm doing okay, but I have a number of dietary
restrictions that I need to follow (at least for the time being). I did not
follow them as consistently as I should have. Luckily, my body was there to
provide an immediate reminder of who (literally) wears the pants in our
relationship. This week should be a bit more consistent if I've learned
anything—a big "if".

I also spent a lot of time refreshing my memory of [Unity3D](unity3d.com).
Well, I spent most of my time configuring (Neo)Vim for C♯ auto-completion.[^1]
I previously made the game [DISEF][disef] as well as an "unreleased" and
unfinished game. 

Lastly, I'm moving to San Francisco. I'll miss you, Berkeley. Especially your
pizza. Not that I won't be going back for the pizza (see, already violating
the dietary restrictions).

I've got to get better at avoiding pitfalls that I've entered time and time
again, with regards to work, time management, health management, anxiety,
organization, etc. The types of mistakes I've compiled here.

# Consumption

I have an income now. I'm very fortunate in that respect. I don't have to worry
about where I'm going to find my next meal, how I'm going to get around, what
will happen (financially) if I get injured, etc. As a side-effect, I now feel
the full brunt of advertising. Things that I might actually buy are being
directed towards me, constantly. This isn't really *new* per se, but it is so
strange being in this position now. It feels simultaneously empowering and
revolting. I haven't made anything in a while, yet I've spent so much more in
the past 3 months than any previous 3 months in memory. I'm not against
personal spending in general[^2] but right now it feels...unmotivated.
Consumption for people that I love and care about I can justify. Consumption of
media I can justify. Consumption of food I can justify. 

We'll see where things go.

Footnotes

[^1]: I wound up going back to [YouCompleteMe][ycm] after using the much lighter [deoplete][deoplete] because of its much better OmniSharp integration. I know you probably didn't ask but there you go.
[^2]: Anymore, at least. This was historically a huge source of anxiety, guilt, and depression.
