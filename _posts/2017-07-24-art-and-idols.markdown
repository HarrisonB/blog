I was extremely fortunate to be able to go to Comic-Con in San Diego this past
weekend. It was incredibly fun and I think I learned a lot.

# Idols

I was able to briefly talk with some childhood heroes at the convention, most
notably Jeff Smith[^1], Scott McCloud[^2], and Scott C.[^3] Interacting with
your idols is incredibly weird. You "know" so much about them but they know
essentially nothing about you. If they are quite famous, they may be constantly
bombarded with praise, meaning your words may have little to no weight. So do
you say anything? There's an impulse to try, especially given the rarity of
the opportunity. 

But...the interaction is so brief. And who benefits? These songs of praise for
celebrities are mostly about the singer...so they ought to *mean* something to
them. And not as baseless cherishing of some fleeting interaction, but as a
pivot—as some sort of a "landmark moment". Something that can mark the current
position on a journey, either as a sign of the start of change or the
acknowledgement of hard work done. This meaning can't *always* be summoned,
especially in the context of uncontrollable environments, such as a rancorous
convention floor.

In summary, here are my suggestions if you meet someone who had a great impact
on you for the first time:
1. Acknowledge they probably *can't* care about you
2. Don't outstay your welcome (it will be more brief than you expect)
3. Use the experience as a pivot or a trophy

# Fandom

Comic-Con is an event that condenses the energy of fan obsession and gives it a
spot in which to precipitate. There's nothing wrong with that (inherently,
anyway). But it's a space where *successful* artist and *successful* brands are
even more *successful*. If you dream for something like that, but are years
away from that level of talent or popularity, the experience is a tad
demoralizing.  The people who are not already massively popular often succeed
(especially financially) by selling fan art merchandise—by reproducing someone
else's creative vision and not being able to express their own.

It's easy for me to understand why. I purchased a number of pieces at the
event, but I only bought one item[^5] that wasn't from a personal favorite
franchise. Even when you're financially stable, it seems difficult to take
these sorts of "gambles" on media, especially when you are being blasted on all
sides with new and emerging content.

There's a new YouTube channel that I started watching called [Binging with
Babish][babish-yt]—a tightly edited series in which a chef cooks food from TV
and film. I've probably put at least 2.5 hrs worth of time into this channel.
It's amazing what bite-sized pieces of audio-visual content can do for
attracting an audience. I'm not saying the content is no good—it's quite well
done, in fact. It's just that its built up an audience (>1 million subscribers
in less than a year) that would take an online original textual/comic/audio a
*much* longer time to develop if starting from an unknown source, and/or not
featuring household names like *It's Always Sunny* and *Seinfeld*.

Most articles[^6] that I've read about this sort of thing quickly veer into
this act of flicking off young people and lamenting the sorry state of our
culture. But I think the issue is one of surplus. We're living in ~~a~~ *the*
Golden Age of Television. We have a new method of media delivery that reaches
80% of 18-49 year olds that has 300 hours of content uploaded to it [every
*minute*][yt-statistics].

We need to be cooking our own healthier meals with environmentally-friendly and
ethically raised food. We need to be exercising. We need to be getting more
sleep. We need to be advancing our careers so we can afford to pay for our
kids. We need to go to therapy. We need to be learning so that we remain
relevant and interesting. We need to be reading about our own history because
we don't understand it. We need to be reading the news constantly because the
events of the week are messaged, discussed, and forgotten at an accelerating
rate. We need to be informed about politics on a local, state, and federal
level. We need to be providing emotional support to those around us. We need to
be loving our partners, looking for partners, and/or taking time for ourselves.[^7]

We need to consume art constantly. We need it because we are feeling so much,
so fast. But people are *making* art constantly. They are feeling so much, so
fast. So here we are, drowning in it. I'm not complaining, but I sure don't
have any plan on how to drink it all in, or at minimum, find the good sips.

There's just no time for any of it.
