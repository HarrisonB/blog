Today we talk about effective communication, albeit in an uncommon way.

# Art

I am a big fan of art in general. I love going to museums and can generally
find something to appreciate in most pieces of art.

I really did not give a damn about art when I was a kid. I recall my parents
taking me to the Getty Museum when I was much younger. To be quite honest, I
could not possibly care less about any part of its collection during my visit.[^1]

Then I read [this book][understanding-comics] by Scott McCloud[^2] in middle
school. It changed my life in a lot of ways, but most notably, it made me
rethink my understanding of what "counts" as art. McCloud gave a fairly open,
personal definition of art, explaining it as "any human activity which doesn't
grow out of our species' two basic instincts: survival and reproduction!"[^4]

Knowing that painting, sculpture, music, etc. was part of this this infinitely
wider collection—essentially the total life experience—made me reconsider the
traditionally labeled media that are bestowed the title of "art." As I got
older, this grew to include more and more avant garde works. This brings me to
Marina Abramović. Abramović, if you have not heard of her, is a fairly famous
performance artist.[^3] Her work is known for being highly provocative, unsettling, and (as
performance art often is) debated on its status as "art".

Her most popularly famous piece seems to be the most recent <i>The Artist Is
Present</i>, in which she sat at a table in the Museum of Modern Art for around
750 hours while many people, one at a time, came and visited, all in silence.
They sat down and stared into Marina's eyes for a brief period before the next
waiting patron took their place. 

Here is one of the more famous moments, in which Abramović was visited by her
former romantic and artistic partner Ulay. They separated in 1988 after over a
decade of companionship.

There are many articles about <i>The Artist Is Present</i> ([here's
one][taip-the-atlantic] from The Atlantic), but it's not the piece I want to
talk about.

I want to talk about <i>Rhythm 0</i>.

In 1974, Abramović stood in a room with a group of visitors. There was a table
nearby, in addition to some instructions:

> Instructions.<br />
> There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.<br />
> Performance.<br />
> I am the object.<br />
> During this period I take full responsibility.<br />
> 
> Duration: 6 hours (8 pm – 2 am)


A sampling of the 72 objects:
* A rose
* A feather
* Honey
* Bread
* Wine
* Scissors
* A scalpel
* Nails
* A metal bar
* A pistol loaded with a single bullet

From accounts of what happened, the evening started out kindly enough: people
would give Marina a rose or they might kiss her on the cheek. Eventually the
events took a bit of a turn. Her clothes were cut off, body scratched with
thorns, her neck sliced open and sucked. Eventually, an audience member jammed
the loaded pistol against her, coiling her hand around the trigger. Before any
shot could be fired, a competing faction of the audience wrestled the gun away
and threw it out of reach.

Throughout the six hours, Abramović did not fight or protest any action taken
against her. At the end of the performance, she broke from this state beginning
to move. Upon seeing her animate normally, the entire audience fled.

Many pieces are often beautiful in how one's response *is* the art itself;
rarely is this fact as obvious in <i>Rhythm 0</i>. The performance begs
comparison to famous psychological experiments such [as those at
Stanford conducted 3 years prior][stanford-prison-experiment].

It's strange that today there's a lack of fundamental surprise to all of this,
(at least, for me).  Part of me wants to believe I'm informed by those
psychological experiments, but another part of me knows it as intuition from
spending time on the internet. When you're given a mask, looking at a world
translated into text, image, and low-res video, who's to say it isn't all just
a game of Garry's Mod? Sometimes it's under a guise of internet vigilante
justice but for others it's just a Joker-esque plot. It's a shame that the
tactile knowledge of someone's humanity isn't enou—Wow. It's amazing how easily
it is for these sorts of posts to approach one of those judgemental think
pieces decrying a generation or culture.

Let's rewind a bit. 

Often when I sit down to try to draw or paint something, I have something that
I can't describe articulately—something that I want to cough out of my head and
onto a page. For many people making art, that's what the process is all about:
effective communication. I am trying to capture a bit of *my* experience and
send it to others. That's a big part of what this blog is about, too.

But Abramović's <i>Rhythm 0</i> is about letting the audience communicate for
themselves.  So is it *effective* communication? More so than most pieces I
think. Whatever the repercussions of the audience's actions, the repercussions
were *theirs to own*, whether Marina claimed responsibility or not. Her death
that night, had it happened, would not have been suicide. Her body was the
object, and in the piece's archiving, a board, a journal, or a canvas onto
which those audience members could record something. What they thought about
her, what they didn't think. What they thought they had the right to do and the
obligation to stop.  And in their work they said something about themselves.
Something clear and unmistakable. They just didn't want to see it walking.

So take inspiration <i>Rhythm 0</i> when you are faced with the challenge of
expressing simply and clearly with aims to captivate. Communication is a human
procedure; human impacts are the ones we digest most readily. We humans tend to
relate via projection. It's the reason Marina's photo above may have given you
pause and [the reason simple cartoons are drawn so universally
engaging][masking-wiki]. We see ourselves bloodied in reading, hearing, seeing
these experiences. We'll feel the pain of walking a mile in someone else's
shoes—the main thing stopping us is just putting the damn things on. Give your
audience a shoehorn. Or just give me a shoehorn. It takes me fucking forever to
put my shoes on.
