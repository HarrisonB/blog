I moved again. This time to San Francisco.

<!--more-->

## San Francisco

I'm living here now. Thank you to my friends and family that helped with the
move. I still owe y'all lunch.

## Moving and building a home

I moved a lot growing up. Generally it was around the same area (only
occasional school changes) but kitchens and bedrooms were transient. I've also
moved 6 times in the past 4 years. In these moves, I suppose I have unlearned
the value of the home. I have a number of things I care about (mostly gifts
from friends) but most of it will outlast me and those I care about.  I'm not
sure I ever really settle into a new place, either. It's here one day and then
on another it's gone.

## Cooking

I cooked for the first time in a long while this week. I made pasta alio e olio
based on [this recipe][bwb-pasta-recipe][^1]. It's a very simple, indulgent,
and subtly flavored recipe (except perhaps for its heat). I loved it.

## Video Essays

When I was a jaded youth in high school, I really despised the essay. I hated
that there were no creative writing opportunities in class. I wrote a bit
outside of class[^2] but not a huge volume of work—I was a angsty teen, after
all. I wanted to vent my generic and misplaced resentment in some elaborate
artistic piece, sure, but the thrill of that task was consistently dwarfed by
the thought of doing *absolutely fucking nothing*. 

Nothing wasn't exactly *nothing* It was filled with watching videos on the
internet. Like a hearty diet of Froot Loops and Pop-Tarts, this practice
consistently filled me until my awareness sprung up suddenly or until my clock
passed 1:00 AM.

Many of these videos were educational. Still to this day, I ingest many
educational videos. Some have certainly changed my perceptions about things
(sculpture, music, and film to name a few) but this is pretty rare. Most of
what they have done is fill time. They fill a *lot* of time.

Ironically, a wealth of my time is filled with essays. Video essays. Videos
intended to convince you of something through rational argument. I love Idea
Channel, Extra Credits, Every Frame a Painting, the Nerdwriter [^4].

So why are people making these video essays?

* **Because it is we are not asked to write stories.** We are asked to write
essays. We are asked that in 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade. So
when we have the opportunity to make anything, we make an essay.

* **Because we all want to make *something*.** The
internet is a box. It's a question. It's a canvas. And everyone who uses it a
lot wants to fill it, answer it, or mark it. There are so many different points
of entry. Most commonly it is social media that provides a door, but for others
it's not enough. To build a home is fine but to found a city is better, they
think. Motivations be damned, they upload a video. And what is that video?  It
is content that they can make themselves, probably without years of specialized
training. Some of it is original story, imitating and innovating upon its
inspiration, but a lot of it is the analytical, whether about one's own life or
the world around them. And for many of them, the day to day is not very
interesting. They work in jobs that may, in fact, enrich our lives tremendously.
However, this is often difficult to encapsulate in a 5 minute video and even
more difficult to make appealing to an unfamiliar and busy audience. So the
content uses its creators' canons—the shared culture that formed the background
of their upbringing, a period in which their tastes may have been more amiable
to the restricted selections of "culture" curated by their parents, guardians,
siblings, etc. So they make things that are relatable[^3], or at the very least,
built with a familiar entryway. And the best[^5] of this stuff, made by real
*professionals* certainly, makes it to the top.

Sorry for the Spotify embed. Couldn't find it on YouTube.
