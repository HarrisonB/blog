I haven't had blog post in a while, so here we are.

<!--more-->

The past couple of weeks had me away from this blog for two polar opposite
reasons. First, I had a period of great drawing productivity, making stuff I
was proud of and enjoying drawing process as well. Second, I had a lapse of
productivity. I didn't really draw much of anything. I would start something
and stop, disappointed and (frankly) a little disgusted with what I had managed
to put on paper.

I don't think I've been particularly private in my experiences with depression,
but I probably haven't forthcoming enough that I would earn the adjective
"public," either. With this post, I want to open it all up a bit.

Last December, I made this list of the ways in which depression makes my life
worse. Right off the bat, this sounds like a pointless or, even worse, damaging
exercise. And this intuitions are right: it did not help, despite its accurate
contents. 

At the time I was struggling with this notion that in order to create things
that were somehow "great"[^1], be it comics, stories, or ideas in general, the
creator had to be coming from a place of suffering. Objectively I knew this was
a stupid idea: obviously pain can be a sort of "nucleation site" for the
generation of relatable, compelling ideas, but in its continued presence,
little can truly *happen*. It's too immobilizing.

Ergo, one of the items I wrote down in that list was this:

> Depression makes me less productive

Today was a perfect example.

I use a text editor called [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)[^2] for all of my
writing. Whether it's coding or blogging, it's typed in Vim. It's an minor
evolution of a command-line text editor from the 1970s so it looks very
"hacker"-esque.

Vim is distinct from most newer text editors in that it's navigated with
(basically) no usage of the mouse/trackpad and instead relies on the keyboard.
This (along with tons of other features) makes it *way* faster at
manipulating text than something like, Microsoft Word or TextEdit.
It's also incredibly customizable‚Äîthat screenshot above probably looks pretty
different from most other Vim users' respective setups.

Why does any of this matter? Because it's what makes Vim a *trap* (for me at
least).

Vim put this idea in my head that may be familiar to other programmers:
everything can be optimized to a peak efficiency. And with that logic, little
tweak (e.g.  keyboard shortcuts, UI enhancements, etc.) *matters*‚Äîit's what
makes you faster, or just plain *better*.

This is not true. There are truths buried within this[^3], certainly, but the
spirit of "optimization" can drive you far from where you need to be.

Which brings me to this morning. I spent roughly 9 hours of today learning
about [Vimscript][lvsthw], the language that one uses to customize and control
Vim.  While I wouldn't say this information is utterly useless, the time spent
to take it in will [*never*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely) be
recouped.

But it's a powerful distraction‚Äîstrong enough to volley me out of my endless
rotary pit of ùÑÜ Reddit ‚Üí Facebook ‚Üí Instagram ‚Üí Twitter ‚Üí YouTube ùÑá. That being
said, it's still just a pit. And throughout my learning today, I knew that. And
it frustrated me to no end. I'm still kicking myself.

These "distraction pits" are so tempting for because they can't offer the same
disappointment that *production* can. Today was another lesson that they can
still hurt tremendously.

Thank you for reading. Here is a song I've been listening to a lot recently.
