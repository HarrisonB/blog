I've been to the SFMOMA twice now, and both times I've been especially struck by
Richard Serra's <i>Gutter Corner Splash: Night Shift</i>.

The work is quite large. It dominates the room it (alone) occupies. You enter
and you want to approach it. It looks incapable of pushing out or pulling in any
ship with its rising and falling waves, but still draws you closer like any
timeless shore just might.

However, approaching the silver crests, you stop. Not because of any security
guard. Not because of some rope. The piece itself pushes back. As signs alert
you, each of the 15 feet long forms is composed entirely of lead.

No, not the lead of pencils. The lead of Roman pipe and Elizabethan makeup fame.
The lead of industrial and automotive revolution. The lead of occupational
hazards. The lead of gout, seizures, and learning disabilities. It is a metal
with both a storied history and a long list of victims. All of this becomes
immediate and tangible when you walk in this room. The waves demand this
material's respect—for both its primordiality and lethality. In a weight
numbering in tons.

The crude forms originate from their casting method, which you can probably tease
out from the piece's name. In the quiet of night,[^1] artist Richard Serra would
fling melted lead into this same room's corner. It would eventually solidify
into a single "wave," for him and his crew to heave mere inches back.

There are so many different ways to look at <i>Gutter</i>—like many
pieces of modern art. Here are just a few that spring to mind.

### Violence

It comes to mind here. The throwing of molten-hot metal, chaotically splashing
and burning its way into the wall and floor; it's this piece's *birth*. It could
melt skin off bone, knock one into a seizure[^2], or scar limbs for life merely
by sloshing around in its boisterous[^3] liquid phase. And when it slams
against the room's surfaces, it splashes, it cools, and it dies. It sits,
immobile, marking the wall with its last energetic jumps and dances. The lead
is now elephantine and unforgettable in weight yet yielding like spongy bone[^4]. It must
be dragged, scraping-screaming, by a team of men who watched it freeze and did
nothing. A rowdy, poisonous child perishing at the gloved hand of its
father, lined up with the rest of its misshapen, haggard, and discolored
siblings, with the living ones still playing in the cauldron.

### Industry

These waves serve as a juncture, representing two periods: the individually
unique and unrefined output of prehistoric people, throwing just something at
the wall and seeing what sticks[^5] as well as the more recent industrial
developments, with its toxic materials, mass production, and reckless
manufacturing location.

### Purity

The bars are 100% lead. And yet they look so grotesque and diseased. 
Their source looks to be almost a stain or blight upon the otherwise plain and
clean room. Like [bewitched inbred
royalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain) they strike a mix 
between regal[^6] and pitiable, but, above all, they appear to be the product of an
eternal, reprehensible process—the scratching off of hybridity and the strength
it provides[^7] for the attainment of some arbitrary and useless notion of
"decontamination".

### Permanence

The piece itself is never moved. Its size, material composition, and toxicity
make any such task intractable[^8]. Instead, the walls must be torn down and
built-up as necessary.[^9] As such, the room in which it is located becomes as
much a part of <i>Gutter</i> as the lead bars.[^10] But the lead contrasts all
that surrounds it so prominently in age: while perhaps only smelted a few
decades ago, lead as an element is produced in supernovae[^11], predating any
other part of the room by billions of years. And given enough time, most heavy
elements similarly supernova-borne decay into it as well.[^12] It is timeless
and all-encompassing in that way.

I think often times we shirk the responsibility thrown on us in inspecting
minimalist sculpture. But it's a fulfilling undertaking that often tells you a
lot about yourself, the artist, history, or all the above and more. You don't
need to be an expert. Just be willing to see where your feelings take you—and
maybe willing to read up about art a bit! If you're up to give it a shot, I
highly encourage you to visit a modern art museum.
